# Titanic_DataAnalysis

Using Pandas and Numpy, I performed basic data analysis on the deathtoll of the Titanic. Here I discovered as to how many people died, which statusclass suffered the most, which gender suffered the most and many other information.

# Interpretation
* The percentage of survivors of the Titanic were only about 38%

* When we group the people by Gender we see that only 18% of the Men survived and about 74% of Females survived

* When we further Group the genders to their Classes of their Tickets we can see that 96.8% of the women in Firstclass and 92.1% of the women in SecondClass survived

* Lastly when we see the above case but under the age of 18 we can notice that all the women of Secondclass and all the men of the firstclass survived

So we can see that we can perform basic data analytics on any Excel data using Numpy and Pandas libraries of Python which are specifically used for DataAnalytics
